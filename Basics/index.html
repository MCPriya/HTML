        The Ginger Bread man

            <strong>Then she went up to sweep the parlor,</strong> and she swept and she swept till the clock struck
            twelve, when she dropped her broom in a hurry, and exclaiming, “Lawks! <em>the gingerbread will be all baked
                to a cinder,” </em>she ran down into the kitchen, and threw open the oven door. And the square cakes
            were all done, nice and hard and brown, and the round cakes were all done, nice and hard and brown, and the
            gingerbread man was all done too, nice and hard and brown; and he was standing up in his corner, with his
            little caraway-seed eyes sparkling, and his raisin mouth bubbling over with mischief, while he waited for
            the oven door to be opened. The instant the door was opened, with a hop, skip, and a jump, he went right
            over the square cakes and the round cakes, and over the cooks arm, and before she could say “Jack Robinson”
            he was running across the kitchen floor, as fast as his little legs would carry him, towards the back door.

            which was standing wide open, and through which he could see the garden path.He thought at once that the cat
            must have stolen something, and that it was the cat the cook wanted him to stop. Now, if there was anything
            that Towser liked, it was going after the cat, and he jumped up the walk so fiercely that the poor cat did
            not have time to stop herself or to get out of his way, and they came together with a great fizzing, and
            barking, and meowing, and howling, and scratching, and biting, as if a couple of Catherine-wheels had gone
            off in the wrong way and had got mixed up with one another.When the gingerbread man saw the dog coming, he
            jumped down on the farther side of the wall, and began running across the field. Now in the middle of the
            field was a tree, and at the foot of the tree was lying Jocko, the monkey. He wasn’t asleep—monkeys never
            are—and when hesaw the little man running across the field and heard the cook calling, “Jocko, Jocko, stop
            the gingerbreadman,” he at once gave one big jump. But he jumped so fast and so far that he went right over
            the gingerbread man, and as luck would have it, he came down on the back of Towser, the dog, who had just
            scrambled over the wall, and whom he had not before noticed. Towser was naturally taken by surprise, but he
            turned his head around and promptly bit off the end of the monkey’s tail, and Jocko quickly jumped off
            again, chattering his indignationAs he came down, he could see through the window in the field beyond the
            garden the cook, and the dog, and the monkey, and could even hear the barking of Towser and the chattering
            of Jocko. He scampered down the walk, with his little bare feet pattering against the warm gravel, climbed
            over the wall, and in a few seconds arrived under the tree, just as Jocko was holding up the poor little
            gingerbread man.Meanwhile, the gingerbread man had climbed up on the garden wall, and stood on the top with
            his hands in his pockets, looking at the scrimmage, and laughing till the tears ran down from his little
            caraway-seed eyes and his raisin mouth was bubbling all over with fun.
